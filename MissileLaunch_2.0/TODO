BUGS:
Commenting out the 'GetDateTime()' function still lets the program run when it checks the license. [FIXED]

Allow file name to be downloaded as random gen letter, numbers and symbols to make the program more secure. [FIXED]

It is recommended that you have your device connected to the internet
for at least one full minute, this is to ensure that your device
has completely connected to the internet to avoid any network issues
while the game is starting up and setting up configurations.
